# MyJavaPlayground

Welcome to my experimental Java repository! This is where I mess around with Java concepts, test new things, and generally try to figure out how stuff works. Nothing here is polished, organized, or guaranteed to make sense.

## About This Repository

- **Purpose:** A personal sandbox for testing Java code and learning GitHub.
- **Main Focus:** Java programming, SQL practice, and general software experimentation.
- **Audience:** Just me (for now), but feel free to take a look if you're curious.

## What You'll Find Here

- Random Java classes
- Probably some broken code

* Test projects that may or may not be useful in the future

## How to Use

If for some reason you're interested in my messy learning process:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone (https://github.com/LauraCodes35/MyJavaPlayground)
2. Open in an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse.
3. Run, modify, and break the code as needed.

## Future Plans

- Keep learning Java.
- Figure out how GitHub actually works.
- Maybe add some documentation when I stop winging it.
